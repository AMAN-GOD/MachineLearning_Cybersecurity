# To run this app:
# 1. Save the code as a Python file (e.g., `spam_app.py`).
# 2. Make sure 'tfidf_vectorizer.pkl', 'spam_detector_model.pkl', and 'scaler.pkl' are in the same directory.
# 3. Open your terminal or command prompt.
# 4. Navigate to the directory where you saved the file.
# 5. Run the command: `streamlit run spam_app.py`
# 6. Your web browser will automatically open the app.
